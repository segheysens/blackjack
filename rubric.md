## Project Workflow
I love your readme doc! I really love how detailed it is. Seems very thoroughly planned. It also includes things you want to include going forward and that's pretty cool.

## Technical Requirements
It's very apparent you learned a thing or two in the last couple of weeks. I see no major flaws, although the UI is a bit buggy and i'm not entirely sure what current turn is. But your knowledge of JS and jQuery is pretty evident.

## Creativity
UI looks nice and clean, its a bit buggy with the positioning when you click certain buttons. I like the shadowing though, that's pretty neat.

## Code Quality
Code quality is definitely above average. You've abstracted a bunch of functionality and it all looks properly indented and well maintained. IE I love you commenting. keep that up. That will be super valuable as you go forward as a developer.

## Problem Solving
I would say Blackjack was probably the most complicated prompt of all the project prompts. I think you did a nice job breaking it down into component parts.

## Total
~1.5 Meet/Exceeds Expectations. You did a really great job on this project! To truly exceed expectations I would love to see the UI be a bit less buggy and more fluid. Additionally, I think using an array of objects to represent the deck would help scalability and modularity for your code. Very few people were able to implement the Ace functionality, however, which you were able to do and I think that's really awesome. Great job overall!
