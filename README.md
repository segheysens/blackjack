# blackjack - http://segheysens.github.io/blackjack/
A small blackjack game created for the first project assignment during my GA Web Development Immersive.

So this was looking kinda jenky, was linked to from my website, etc.
I made it look better, more material, there's a menu, instructions. It's not
meant to replace your favorite blackjack app, but it was fun for practicing
my frontend skillz. It has a snazzy little menu, SVG social icons, object-oriented
game design. I'm happy.

If I remember to, I'll come back to this and add a small list of the last several
hands, because right now it may look like a turn got skipped, but it's because
the dealer got 21. I may also add betting, splits, and insurance eventually.
